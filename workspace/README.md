Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the proposed architecture for the ReactJS website:

1. `App.js`: The entry point of the application that renders the main components.

2. `TopMenu.js`: A component that represents the top navigation menu of the website.

3. `SideBar.js`: A component that represents the sidebar of the website.

4. `ContentArea.js`: A component that represents the main content area of the website.

5. `index.js`: The main file that renders the `App` component and mounts it to the DOM.

Now, let's proceed with creating the files and adding the code for each one.

`App.js`
