    title: 'Classes and Objects',
    content: 'In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class.'

    title: 'Inheritance and Polymorphism',
    content: 'Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class inherits the properties and methods of another class. It allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.'
